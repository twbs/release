## Release plan

New releases of Bootstrap are made from the `main` branch to the *Active* major version. At times to be determined by the release working group, major versions will be frozen and transitioned to *Long Term Support* (LTS). A long term support branch will be forked from `main`, making way for semver-major changes to be made on `main` and a new *Active* major version to be prepared.

A version in *Long Term Support* should not have new features landed without a compelling reason. It may continue to receive:

* Bug fixes
* Security updates
* Documentation updates

After a determined period of time, versions in Long Term Support will be deep-frozen and transition to *Maintenance*.

Versions in *Maintenance* should not have any changes landed, except for:

* **Critical** bug fixes
* **Critical** security updates
* **Important** documentation updates

Unless a change is urgent, *Maintenance* releases are likely to be made with minimal frequency.
